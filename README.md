# Bourso CLI

This app aims to be a simple CLI powered by *[Bourso API](./bourso-api/)* to log in to your [BoursoBank/Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com) account and achieve some basic tasks.

The first goal is to be able to [DCA (Dollar Cost Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) on given [ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) on a regular basis with your Bourso account.

A [GitHub issue follows the progress](https://github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/issues/1).
