# Bourso CLI

This app aims to be a simple CLI powered by *[Bourso API](./src/bourso_api/)* to log in to your [BoursoBank/Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com) account and achieve some basic tasks.

The first goal is to be able to [DCA (Dollar Cost Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) on given [ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) on a regular basis with your Bourso account.

A [GitHub issue follows the progress](https://github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/issues/1).

## Usage
You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/releases).

Choose the right binary for your OS between:
- `bourso-cli-darwin.tar.gz` for MacOS. 
    - After extracting the archive, right click on the binary and select "Open" to bypass MacOS app check.
- `bourso-cli-linux.tar.gz` for Linux
- `bourso-cli.exe` for Windows

‚ö†Ô∏è Signing in with a different IP address than the ones you usually use will trigger a security check from Bourso. You'll have to validate the connection from your phone. A [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/azerpas/bourso-api/pull/10) is open to handle this case.

### Configuration
Save your client ID with this config command:
```
./bourso-cli config
```
The password will be asked each time you run the app to avoid storing it in a file.

### Get your accounts
```
./bourso-cli accounts
```
You'll get something like this:
```
[
    Account {
        id: "1a2953bd1a28a37bd3fe89d32986e613",
        name: "BoursoBank",
